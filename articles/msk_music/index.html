msk_music GitHub Gist
msk_music is a simple and featureless way of listening to music. It uses the
equivalent of &ldquo;random&rdquo; and &ldquo;consume&rdquo; modes on mpd (which it aims to replace).
For my use cases, which I believe are fairly standard, it does so successfully."><link rel=canonical href=https://veilm.github.io/><link rel=icon href=/favicon.png><link rel=stylesheet href=/sakura.css type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=/main.css type=text/css><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=PT+Serif:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><title>msk_music | Michael Skyba</title></head><body><h1>msk_music</h1><p>by Michael Skyba<br>(Initially written on 2021-07-23)</p><hr><p>I have decided to put this to use for sharing scripts I write, in hopes that one

list that contains web URLs, but that would be weird.</p><p>Playing music locally instead of through a streaming service offers a few
advantages:</p><ul><li>You can listen to your music even when you&rsquo;re offline.</li><li>You can listen to music without the use of online streaming platforms, which
often have required payments, advertisements, bloated, slow, resource-hogging
user interfaces, etc.</li><li>You can listen to the same music in any client that you like, of which there
are many on Linux.</li><li>Since it&rsquo;s your filesystem, you can perform your own automation for
organization, renaming, etc.</li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t care how you listen to your music or if you listen to music at all; I&rsquo;m
just explaining my motivation for using this system instead of e.g. Spotify.</p><blockquote><p>But how am I supposed to get the local audio?</p></blockquote><p>This is only a problem if you lack basic digital literacy, in which case you
definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in some random shell script on the internet.
That said, I usually save any new music I like to a YouTube playlist and then
download the playlist with <a href=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>yt-dlp</a> once it
starts filling up. I don&rsquo;t understand why people bother with torrenting when
this seems so much easier.</p><hr><a href=..>Article Index</a></body></html>
