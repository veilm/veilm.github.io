able to get Chapter 1 working on Linux. I will assume you&rsquo;re running Arch.
1. Download the .exe
This would be from Deltarune&rsquo;s website.
2. Install Wine and libstrangle
su -c "pacman -S wine"
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/libstrangle-git.git
cd libstrangle-git
makepkg -sirc
3. Install Deltarune as if you were on Windows using Wine
wine SURVEY_PROGRAM_WINDOWS_ENGLISH.exe
For me, it stopped writing new text after a couple of minutes, at which point I
killed it with ^C. I guess it finishes installing but doesn&rsquo;t quit Wine?'><link rel=canonical href=https://veilm.github.io/><link rel=icon href=/favicon.png><link rel=stylesheet href=/sakura.css type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=/main.css type=text/css><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=PT+Serif:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><title>Deltarune Chapter 1 on Linux | Michael Skyba</title></head><body><h1>Deltarune Chapter 1 on Linux</h1><p>by Michael Skyba<br>(Initially written on 2021-09-17)</p><hr><p>With the release of Deltarune Chapter 2 today, I thought I would share how I was

work (extreme framerate issues). Feel free to try it if you don&rsquo;t believe me.</p><h3 id=update-2021-09-17-20-50>Update: 2021-09-17-20-50</h3><p>A few hours after I posted the article, and with the reveal of Chapter 2,
Deltarune (the &ldquo;demo&rdquo;, at least) was released on Steam. So, you can now simply
play it through Proton instead of installing Wine and everything.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave this article up in case someone wants to avoid Steam. From my limited
testing, the itch.io download for Chapters 1&amp;2 also worked fine under Wine.</p><hr><a href=..>Article Index</a></body></html>
