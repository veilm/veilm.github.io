work (extreme framerate issues). Feel free to try it if you don&rsquo;t believe me.</p><h3 id=update-2021-09-17-20-50>Update: 2021-09-17-20-50</h3><p>A few hours after I posted the article, and with the reveal of Chapter 2,
Deltarune (the &ldquo;demo&rdquo;, at least) was released on Steam. So, you can now simply
play it through Proton instead of installing Wine and everything.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave this article up in case someone wants to avoid Steam. From my limited
testing, the itch.io download for Chapters 1&amp;2 also worked fine under Wine.</p><hr><a href=..>Article Index</a></body></html>
