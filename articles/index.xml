&lt;p>A few weeks ago now, I finished my twelfth year of public education, and
graduated from my high school. At last?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can still picture myself inside the graduation ceremony. The ceiling fans
did little to quell the heat. The graduation gown the board decided on, sold by
a company whose X account I now see has 8 followers, stuck to my increasingly
sweaty wrists. I tried rotating the position of the sleeve every fifteen
minutes, while wondering how much better at negotiating I&amp;rsquo;d have needed to be to
escape my parent/guardian&amp;rsquo;s command to attend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RSS with a private Nitter instance</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/nitter-private-rss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 20:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/nitter-private-rss/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="2024-10-11-update">2024-10-11 Update&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A while ago now, some endpoints were disabled, and the Python script mentioned
in this article will no longer generate any credentials. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time right
now to update this with new instructions. Sorry. Hopefully some part can still
be helpful for reference.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As of around March 2023, the method I came up with will no longer work for a
user who does not have access to the album ID of their Profile Photos album
(which is you, in most cases). Of course, I never received any email, although I
doubt anybody at Google even read the article. This was probably just a regular
UX update that patched the method coincidentally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Becoming a PulseAudio user</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/becoming-a-pulseaudio-user/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 10:44:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/becoming-a-pulseaudio-user/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days ago, I decided to bite the bullet and install PulseAudio. I did so
through PipeWire, though, so by &amp;ldquo;PulseAudio&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be referring to the
&lt;code>pipewire-pulse&lt;/code> system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While most Linux users either have it shipped with their distribution by
default, have it as a dependency of other software they rely on, or install it
themselves once they boot into their system for the first time, I was part of
the minority who decided to say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Operating Systems</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/operating-systems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 11:13:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/operating-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this &amp;ldquo;article&amp;rdquo;, I will write about several different operating
systems that I have used. I am not an expert on any of them and there is
a high chance that none of my rambling will be useful to anybody. I am
mostly writing this &amp;ldquo;for fun&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;for myself&amp;rdquo;, if that makes sense.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I first got my laptop, which is the computer I&amp;rsquo;ve used for most of my life,
it came with Windows 10, which I used for a while. For the most part, I thought
it worked fine. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to compare it to. Eventually, however,
after repeatedly hearing about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux&lt;/a> and
how it was supposedly &amp;ldquo;good for programmers&amp;rdquo;, I decided to try it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scripture</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/scripture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 10:59:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/scripture/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is about
&lt;a href="https://github.com/veilm/scripture">scripture&lt;/a>, an SM-2 implementation
that I made. This will not be a rewrite of the README but instead notes on why I
made it, my workflow with it, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sm-2">SM-2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SM-2 is an application of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition&lt;/a>. The idea
is to be able to retain information in your long-term memory while spending as
little total time as possible reviewing it. SM-2 is a popular algorithm due to
it proving to be effective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deltarune Chapter 1 on Linux</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/deltarune-chapter-1-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 10:53:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/deltarune-chapter-1-on-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the release of Deltarune Chapter 2 today, I thought I would share how I was

&lt;p>Recently, I found out about &lt;a href="https://github.com/JLErvin/berry">berry&lt;/a>, which
describes itself as &amp;ldquo;[a] healthy, byte-sized window manager&amp;rdquo;. As of the time I&amp;rsquo;m
writing this, I have used berry for around one day. In this post, I would like
to share my first impressions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="philosophy">Philosophy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The main thing that drew me to berry in the first place was its philosophy.
&lt;a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">dwm&lt;/a>, which I was using before trying berry, does not
follow the UNIX philosophy as well as I would like. In particular, dwm ships
with a statusbar and a hotkey daemon (the latter is not a precise description,
but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what would be a better name; if you use dwm, you know what I&amp;rsquo;m
referring to). Neither of these is part of berry. Additionally, berry has no
built-in tiling. Instead, you can use berryc to create your own layout.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>msk_music</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/msk_music/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 22:12:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/msk_music/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have decided to put this to use for sharing scripts I write, in hopes that one
or two of them could be of use to somebody.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/veilm/2e04107265d4255671bb597581afd76a">msk_music GitHub Gist&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>msk_music&lt;/code> is a simple and featureless way of listening to music. It uses the
equivalent of &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;consume&amp;rdquo; modes on mpd (which it aims to replace).
For my use cases, which I believe are fairly standard, it does so successfully.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get a Working Wi-Fi Connection in an Artix Installation</title><link>https://veilm.github.io/articles/artix-wifi-connection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 21:43:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://veilm.github.io/articles/artix-wifi-connection/</guid><description>&lt;p>While Arch and Gentoo have had internet working mostly out-of-the-box, Artix has
not. I thought it could be beneficial if I compiled a list of steps:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For example, &lt;code>0.0.0.0 example.com&lt;/code>. Here, example.com will basically be an
alias for &amp;ldquo;0.0.0.0&amp;rdquo;, which acts as a dummy address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that this isn&amp;rsquo;t completely reliable. If it&amp;rsquo;s not working, try adding a
second entry with &amp;ldquo;www.&amp;rdquo; and also try restarting your browser (in case, for
example, you&amp;rsquo;re seeing a cached page).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">Here&lt;/a> is a list of sites that you may
want to block.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
